Abstract
This meta-analysis examines the documented effects of climate change on migratory bird patterns across four continents over the past thirty years. Through analysis of 87 peer-reviewed studies, significant correlations between rising global temperatures and altered migration timing were identified. Results indicate that 72% of the studied species have changed their migratory patterns, with an average advance in spring arrival of 2.3 days per decade. These findings suggest that while migratory birds demonstrate some adaptive capacity, the rate of required adaptation may exceed evolutionary capabilities for many species, potentially leading to population decline.

1. Introduction
Migratory birds rely on complex environmental cues to time their seasonal movements, making them particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. This sensitivity to environmental conditions has positioned migratory birds as important bioindicators for climate change research (MÃ¸ller et al., 2010).`
