  exampleText: `The Hidden History of Urban Forests

When we think of forests, we typically imagine vast expanses of wilderness far from civilization. Yet throughout human history, cities and forests have developed a complex, intertwined relationship that continues to shape our urban environments today.

Ancient Rome maintained sacred groves within its boundaries, while medieval European cities often incorporated communal woodlands for resources and recreation. By the 19th century, urban planners like Frederick Law Olmsted began intentionally integrating forest spaces into city designs, recognizing their aesthetic and psychological benefits.

Modern research supports what these historical figures intuited: urban forests provide measurable improvements to air quality, temperature regulation, and mental health. A 2023 study from the Urban Ecology Institute found that neighborhoods with 30% tree canopy coverage experienced average summer temperature reductions of 3.8Â°F compared to similar areas with minimal tree cover.`
