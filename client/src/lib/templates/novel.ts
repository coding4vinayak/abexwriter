  exampleText: `Chapter 1: The Awakening

The old clock on the mantel struck midnight, its hollow chime echoing through the empty house. Sarah's eyes snapped open, her heart racing. Something had changed, though she couldn't quite place what it was.

She pushed aside the worn quilt and crossed to the window. The moon hung low and full, casting long shadows across the overgrown garden. Had it been a sound that woke her? Or something else entirely?

"Hello?" she called, her voice barely above a whisper. "Is someone there?"

Only silence answered her, but the hair on her arms stood on end. The air felt charged, as if a storm approached—though the night sky remained clear and star-filled.

That's when she noticed it: the small wooden box on her dresser. It hadn't been there when she'd gone to bed.`
